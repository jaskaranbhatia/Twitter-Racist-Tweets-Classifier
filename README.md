## Description of the Project
Sentiment Analysis of Racist Tweets on Twitter

The objective of this project is to detect hate speech tweets. For the sake of simplicity, I say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist.
